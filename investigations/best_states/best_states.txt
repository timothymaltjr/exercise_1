This is very similar to the "best hospitals" analysis, except the data is aggregated by state instead of by hospital name.

This query pulls data from two files - the averaged "Score" field in the effectivecare - hospitals.csv file and the average "Score" field in the readmissions - hospital.csv file.  The effective care score is seen as a beneficial score, whereas the readmission scores are viewed as the opposite.

The scores are a range from zero to one hundred (as a percentage) with the Emergency Services filtered out.  The Emergency Services were not on a 0-100 percentage scale and would alter the averages in a wrongful way.

The query groups the state by its effective care score (descending), then with its respective readmission score.
